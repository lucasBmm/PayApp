Steps to make the application made by chatGPT 

1.  Identify the core functionalities: Identify the core functionalities of the application based on the requirements you listed. You should focus on the essential features that are necessary for the user to perform their transactions.
    
2.  Design the database schema: Create a database schema that can handle the transactions and user data for your application. Define the tables and relationships between them, and consider the database's normalization and security measures.
    
3.  Create the backend: Use Spring Boot to create the backend of the application, which should include the REST API endpoints for account creation, balance view, and transaction execution. Implement the logic for processing transactions and verifying user credentials. Don't forget to add security measures such as authentication, authorization, and input validation.
    
4.  Implement the frontend: Use React to create the frontend of the application. Implement the user interface, wire up the REST API endpoints, and create the user interactions necessary for the application's functionalities. Focus on creating an intuitive and responsive user interface that is easy to use and understand.
    
5.  Test and deploy: Test the application to ensure it works as expected and meets the requirements. Deploy the application to a test environment to get feedback from the stakeholders and users. Address any issues that arise, and make improvements based on feedback.

Overall, the first step in creating your prototype should be to define the core functionalities, design the database schema, and then start building the backend and frontend in parallel. It's important to work in an agile and iterative manner, focusing on delivering value to the users as soon as possible.

Sure, here are some steps you could take to develop your payment web application using an agile approach:

Sprint Planning:

Define your product backlog, prioritize the most important user stories, and estimate the effort required for each task.
Break the user stories into smaller tasks and assign them to specific team members.
Plan your first sprint, which should last 1-2 weeks.
Development:

Develop the front-end using React and create mockups to test the user interface.
Develop the back-end using Spring Boot and create RESTful APIs to handle requests and responses.
Develop the database schema using MySQL and define relationships between tables.
Integrate the front-end, back-end, and database to create a functional payment system.
Sprint Review and Retrospective:

Review the work done during the sprint and demonstrate any completed user stories.
Identify any problems encountered and discuss how they can be resolved in the next sprint.
Discuss any opportunities to improve the development process and team collaboration.
Repeat:

Plan the next sprint and repeat the development process until you have completed all user stories and reached your MVP.
Keep in mind that during each sprint, you may discover new requirements or problems that need to be addressed. Be flexible and adjust your plans accordingly.
Testing and Deployment:

Conduct thorough testing of the application to ensure it meets functional and non-functional requirements.
Deploy the application to a staging environment for further testing and refinement.
Once you are satisfied with the application, deploy it to production and monitor its performance.
Remember, agile development is about flexibility, continuous improvement, and delivering value to your customers quickly. Keep your development cycles short, your communication clear, and your team motivated to achieve your goals efficiently.
